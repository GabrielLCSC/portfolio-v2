            <p>As a student in the Coding and Digital Innovation program at IIM, I have always been passionate about this field. </p>
            <p>With the goal of becoming a full-stack developer, I have put my skills to good use in several collaborative projects that have allowed me to evolve both independently and in a team. </p>
            <p>For example, I had the opportunity to work with BRED Banque Populaire, where as a team, we had to propose a visual redesign of their mobile application.</p>
            <p>As I'm still learning, my projects are few and far between, but I continue to evolve every day to propose more and more qualitative content.</p>
